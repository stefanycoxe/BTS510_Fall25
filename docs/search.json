    "text": "2 A few miscellaneous things about R and Quarto\n\n2.1 About R\n\nR is case sensitive\n\nmean is not the same as Mean\nThe object b is not the same as the object B\n\nExtra returns don’t matter\n\nExtra spaces generally don’t matter either\nI often add extra spaces, tabs, and returns to make the code more readable\n\nThe assignment operator is &lt;-\n\n“Put whatever is on the right side in the object named on the left side”\n\nSometimes, equal isn’t equal\n\nIf you’re talking about assigning something to a value, you can use =\nIf you want to compare two values and make a decision based on it, you use ==\n\nThere isn’t a standard, widely-used naming convention for variables, so you should pick something and try to be consistent\n\nIn general, variable names must start with a letter – no numbers or special characters\nThere are some options for multi-word variable naming\n\nvariablename: Just smush it all together\nvariableName or VariableName: Camel case\nvariable_name or Variable_Name: Snake case\nvariable-name or Variable-Name: Kebab case\n\nIn general, make the variable names as short as possible while keeping each name unique\n\n\n\n\n2.2 About Quarto\n\nLook at the top of the Quarto file. The section with --- at the top and bottom. This is the YAML (pronounced “yam-ull”). It provides options for the overall document.\n\ntitle: is pretty obvious\nformat: tells R which output format to produce when you knit the document together\nThis is an html document, but you can specify different or multiple output formats, like both HTML and PDF\n\nThere are additional options that are specific to this format\nembed-resources: true (older version: self-contained: true) and self-contained-math: true make sure that any additional files that are created, like figures, are part of the HTML file. If I didn’t include this and sent you to the HTML file, the figures etc. would be missing.\nhtml-math-method: katex is an option about the equations and math text. It’s probably not necessary, but I include it anyway.\nnumber-sections: true and toc: true produce the table of contents on the right side of this page and number the sections and sub-sections (remember headings and organization?) to make it easier to navigate\ncode-tools: true adds the &lt;/&gt; Code button at the top that shows the code that made this page. You can copy the code (using the little “Copy to clipboard” icon in the upper right) and paste it right into R\ncode-block-bg: true and code-block-border-left: \"#31BAE9\" make the code chunks a little more noticeable – they blended into the background too much otherwise.\nThe YAML is one of the few places that spacing matters. Note how each sub-option is indented more than it’s over-option. If you don’t get this right, the file won’t run\nRead more about YAML options here\n\n\nYou can label each code chunk in the document\n\nThis is a very smart thing to do\n\nI don’t do it consistently :( but I’m trying\n\nIf you have an error, R will tell you which chunk has the problem\n\nIf the chunks are named, it will use the name so it’s easy to find\nIf they’re not named, it will tell you something like “Unnamed chunk 52”, which is way less helpful\n\nName your chunks with #| label: name-of-this-chunk\n\nSee the setup chunk above – that’s just its name, “setup”\n\n\nThere are other options for code chunks. Here are some useful ones\n\necho: true: Repeats the code in the output\nwarning: false: Suppress any warnings from R (not recommended)\neval: false: Don’t run this code, just print it (useful for teaching)\nFor any of these, you can swap from true to false or vice versa and get the opposite effect\nfig-cap: \"My figure caption is cool\": Adds a caption to the figure produced in that chunk – useful for accessibility\nMore info here and here\n\nYou may be used to running small chunks of code individually, even in a large file of R code\n\nQuarto (and markdown) are more about rendering the whole document into an external (html or pdf or doc) file\nClick the “Render” button at the top of the window to render\n\nDepending on the size of the file and what it needs to do, this can take a few minutes\nThe console shows a progress bar with percentage complete"

We will use the gapminder dataset from the gapminder package. Another great source of dataset is the datasets package, which includes commonly used datasets such as iris and mtcars. (Note that if you want to use iris or mtcars, you’ll need to load it – it is installed with R by default, so you don’t need to install it.)\nTo load a dataset, use the data() function\n\ndata(gapminder)"

You should always look at your data to make sure it was read in correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat should your data look like? If you’re doing a typical experimental study, the organization of your dataset should follow a pretty standard format:\n\nEach row is a unit of study (i.e., person, animal, petri dish)\nEach column is a variable\n\nThere are some deviations from this\n\nLongitudinal studies have multiple observations per unit and can be organized 2 different ways\n\nWide or multivariate format: Each repeated measure is a new variable (e.g., X1, X2, X3 for the X variable at 3 different time points)\nTall or stacked or univariate format: Each repeated measure is a new row, so each unit will have multiple rows of data (with an additional variable that indicates which time point is which)\n\nData from non-experiments is often structured differently or even unstructured\n\nWeb scraping\nData from devices or automated processes\nData from someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing…\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 List the dataset\nIf you want to view the dataset, you can just name the dataset. (You can also print() the dataset for the same result.)\n\ngapminder\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n   country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia       1982    39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Afghanistan Asia       1987    40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Afghanistan Asia       1992    41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Afghanistan Asia       1997    41.8 22227415      635.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\n\n\n6.2 head() function\nThe head() function will show the head of the dataset.

If you wanted to check the end for some reason.\n\n\n\n\n6.3 str() function\nThe str() function (“str” = “structure”) tells you about the structure of the dataset. It shows the number of rows and columns, and summarizes some basic info about each variable (like whether it’s a number or character variable and the possible values).\n\n#|label: str\nstr(gapminder)\n\ntibble [1,704 × 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels \"Afghanistan\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ year     : int [1:1704] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...\n $ lifeExp  : num [1:1704] 28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...\n $ pop      : int [1:1704] 8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 14880372 12881816 13867957 16317921 22227415 ...\n $ gdpPercap: num [1:1704] 779 821 853 836 740 ...\n\n\n\n\n6.4 glimpse() function\nThe glimpse() function is in the dplyr package in the tidyverse. We’re going to talk about dplyr more next week, but I wanted to include this function here. This function shows you the number of rows and columns in the dataset. It also flips your dataset so that the variables are rows and prints the dataset out.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nglimpse(gapminder)\n\nRows: 1,704\nColumns: 6\n$ country   &lt;fct&gt; \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", …\n$ continent &lt;fct&gt; Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, …\n$ year      &lt;int&gt; 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n$ lifeExp   &lt;dbl&gt; 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…\n$ pop       &lt;int&gt; 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…\n$ gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt; 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about all those warnings that show up about tidyverse and such after library(tidyverse).
